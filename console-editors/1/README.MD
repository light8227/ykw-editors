# JKSM for 3DS
JKSM or JK's Save Manager for 3DS.
* Dump and Restore save data for 3DS titles
* Dump and Restore extra data for 3DS titles
* Dump and Restore data for system titles
* Dump and Restore Boss extra data
* Set Play Coins to any amount 300 or lower

This is a rewrite that is based on the original's code. I hope to support *hax again someday, but for the time being this is CFW and Rosalina only.
