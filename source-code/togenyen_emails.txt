Hi Togenyan,

I'm hoping to access a schema of a yo kai watch 2 save file. I have tried to inspect the decrypted save file and searched for my Player Name in the save data but it does not appear. Your tool "Yo-Kai Editor 2" is able to interrogate the save file and make changes to it, so I'm hoping that you could point me to a reference of what the save file contains, or perhaps the source code for "Yo-Kai Editor 2" if it is open source.

Really I just want to understand how to edit the player name in a Yo-Kai Watch 2 save file.

Hope you are well
Regards
me

Hi,

> I have tried to inspect the decrypted save file and searched for my Player Name in the save data but it does not appear.

As you might have noticed, there are 2 types of save data file for
Yo-kai watch games;

- head.yw :: metadata (player name, a seed to generate AES key)
- gameX.yw  :: main game data

So you have to decrypt and edit head.yw file, but editing head.yw is
not supported in Yo-kai Editor 2.

head.yw file can be decrypted and encrypted using yw_save.py or Yo-kai Editor 1.

- To decrypt head.yw file with yw_save.py, use --game yw option.

- To edit head.yw file using Yo-kai Editor 1, use internal hex editor
to modify the player name.
  1. Open your head.yw in Yo-kai Editor 1
  2. "Edit >  Edit with hex editor" and edit the player name
  3. Save edited file using "Save as..."

> the source code for "Yo-Kai Editor 2" if it is open source.

My Yo-kai Editor applications are open source, though I have stopped
distributing the binary and source codes.
I'm willing to disclose the source code corresponds to your copy, if
you have downloaded my apps in the past.
If you'd like to obtain it please let me know the name of application
and the version.

Thank you so much!
you're a lifesaver

I obtained all the editors several years ago (binary) but cannot find the source code anywhere :/

My goal is to create a native 3ds app which can edit all yo kai watch saves (regardless of the game) so having access to the source code for Yokai editor 1, 2, 3, B1 & B2 would be immensely helpful.
